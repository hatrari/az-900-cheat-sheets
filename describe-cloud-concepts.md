## Describe the benefitsand considerations of using cloud services

### Cloud computing 
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (the cloud) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, and scale as your business needs change.

### High availability
The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, with very little downtime, depending on the service in question.

### Scalability
The ability to __increase or decrease__ resources for any given workload. You can add additional resources to service a workload (__scaling out__), or add additional capabilities to manage an increase in demand to the existing resource (__scaling up__). Scalability doesn't have to be done automatically.

### Elasticity
The ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease resources as needed. A distinction between scalability and elasticity is that elasticity is done __automatically__.

### Agility
The ability to react __quickly__. Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly.

### Fault tolerance
The ability to remain up and running even in the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning. Typically, redundancy is built into cloud services architecture, so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place.

### Disaster recovery
The ability to recover from an event which has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery can happen very quickly, with automation and services being readily available to use.
